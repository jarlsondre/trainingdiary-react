# TrainingDiary frontend

This is the frontend part of the TrainingDiary app. It is coded in React with Typescript and uses Redux.

## Problems/bugs

The following is a list of known problems/bugs that affect the website:

- When you don't select an exercise, the default value for an exercise is the squat, but the menu actually shows the first item alphabetically. This changes on update, but if you want to actually log the first exercise alphabetically, then you have to select a different exercise and then go back to the first one.

## Ideas

The following is a list of ideas that might or might not be implemented:

- Add comment to each exercise
- Add exercise type (cardio, bodyweight, barbell, dumbbell)
- Add personal exercises
- Add total volume of session
  - Total weight lifted
  - Total number of reps
- Add time session took
  - Need start & finish buttons
  - Could add field where you can type it in
